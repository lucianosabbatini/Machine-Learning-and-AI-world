# How to Stop Robots From Becoming Racist

As AI becomes more prevalent in our lives, it is important to address the issue of biased algorithms. While AI can be a useful tool, it can also reproduce historical racist biases. Researchers have found evidence of this in an experiment where AI systems were shown to discriminate against people of certain races.

Structured racism is a term used to describe the phenomenon where racist biases are embedded in the structure of society, including in technology. Recent examples of biased algorithms include facial recognition software that is less accurate for people with darker skin tones and predictive policing systems that target minority communities.

It is crucial to involve developers from diverse backgrounds in the training of AI systems. However, it is impossible to completely eliminate bias from these systems. The way forward is to measure and mitigate bias as much as possible.

Some examples of quality measurements and institutions that address AI bias include the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning (FAT/ML) community and the Algorithmic Justice League.

Ultimately, it is up to individuals to engage in critical thinking and question the decisions made by AI systems. By doing so, we can work towards a future where AI is used for the benefit of all people, regardless of race or ethnicity.
